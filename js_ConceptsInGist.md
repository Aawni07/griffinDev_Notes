### How browsers execute javascript..?

→ Interpreter
→ translates the program into machine language one line at one time. if an error is encountered in any line it is reported at the same time.
→ example: Javascript

→ compiler
→ processes the entire program at once and at the end, it reports all the errors of the entire program.
→ example: Java

### Ways to write javascript

→ inline scripting
→ we write everything inline,which means we include all the code b/w `<script>` tags

→ external scripting
→ where we write all our javascript code in the external file and then reference the file in our HTML doc.

> console.log(), used to print the output on the screen.
> DevTools, helps the web developers to access the deep internals of their web applications in the browser.

### Literals & Variables

→ Literal, means the data / value.
→ example: 3.14, 500, true, ‘Aawni’
→ `var pi; pi=3.14;` , is a combination of a literal and the variable where `pi`, is the variable which stores the literal `3.14`.

> Variables, declared using `var`,`let`,`const`

→ Declaration Of the variable,  `var x = 10`
→ updation, `x=15`

### Operators

→ `Arthematic`
→ performs addition, subtraction, multiplication & division.
→ +,-,*,/,%

→ `Relational`
→ used to check if the relation has been specified b/w the operands is right or wrong. This is morely related with True/False.
→ >,<,=,≠

→ `Logical`
→ takes boolean and returns boolean value as result.
→ we can also give expressions but these exp must be evaluated to either true or false.
→ AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!)

→ `Equality`
→ represented by `==`
→ this checks if the compared vales are same or not.
